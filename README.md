# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge  
  
Using clustering algorithms to explore whether patients can be placed into distinct groups, to better predict myopia.  
  
The .csv file containing the dataset used is located within the Resources folder. The relevant code, visualisations, and written conclusion can be found within the Myopia.ipynb file.  
  
The dataset used for this project is a reduced dataset from [Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia conducted by the US National Eye Institute](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00000169).
